plainways - find your own way
=============================

Plainways is a web platform which
provides navigation map for the people using wheelchairs.

Plainways is a crucial application for enhancement of the social fabric in a locality. The
application is beneficial for the group of individuals whose mobility is restricted to wheel-
chairs. The application provides routes of movement for them, which makes them inde-
pendent, confident and motivated to move on their own. It aids the relatives of these
individuals in taking care of their kin.

Features:

As previously mentioned, the purpose of the plainways project is to provide a route
planner for wheelchair users. The main features of the system are the following:

• Plan route: the system provides a plan route according to the preferences of the
user. The directions from the start to the end address chosen by the user are
provided in a form of text and map overlay.
• Report incorrect route: the user will have the possibility to report any incorrect
directions provided by the system.
• Give feedback: the user will have the possibility to provide feedback to the admins.
• Creation and management of user profile: the user will be able to create his/her
own user profile. The profile can also be shown, updated or deleted by the user.

Additionally to the main features, there are also other possibilities for the user. For
example, the user can choose whether the public transport should be included in the
directions or save his/her favourite routes.
The system will follow an extensible design in order to allow the implementation of
additional features in the futures. Those can include social features (e.g. buddy system,
community etc). Some of the additional features are presented in the appendix "project
ideas".
