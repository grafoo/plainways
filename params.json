{"google":"","name":"Plainways","body":"plainways - find your own way\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nPlainways is a web platform which\r\nprovides navigation map for the people using wheelchairs.\r\n\r\nPlainways is a crucial application for enhancement of the social fabric in a locality. The\r\napplication is beneficial for the group of individuals whose mobility is restricted to wheel-\r\nchairs. The application provides routes of movement for them, which makes them inde-\r\npendent, confident and motivated to move on their own. It aids the relatives of these\r\nindividuals in taking care of their kin.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:  \r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the purpose of the plainways project is to provide a route\r\nplanner for wheelchair users. The main features of the system are the following:  \r\n\r\n+ Plan route: the system provides a plan route according to the preferences of the\r\nuser. The directions from the start to the end address chosen by the user are\r\nprovided in a form of text and map overlay.\r\n+ Report incorrect route: the user will have the possibility to report any incorrect\r\ndirections provided by the system.\r\n+ Give feedback: the user will have the possibility to provide feedback to the admins.\r\n+ Creation and management of user profile: the user will be able to create his/her\r\nown user profile. The profile can also be shown, updated or deleted by the user.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally to the main features, there are also other possibilities for the user. For\r\nexample, the user can choose whether the public transport should be included in the\r\ndirections or save his/her favourite routes.\r\nThe system will follow an extensible design in order to allow the implementation of\r\nadditional features in the futures. Those can include social features (e.g. buddy system,\r\ncommunity etc). Some of the additional features are presented in the appendix \"project\r\nideas\".\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
